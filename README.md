Methods of training and testing SS3FCN:

	1. Modify data_name,fold_num_train in dataset. Py
	
	2. Change data_name in model3d.py
	
	3. Change data_name in main.py

Important training Settings:

	1.python 3.6
	
	2. Tensorflow - gpu 1.9.0
	
	3. Keras 2.2.4
	
	4.spectral 0.19
	
	5. Other basic python package
	
Note: due to the limitation of upload file size, you need to put the dataset into the "data" folder
